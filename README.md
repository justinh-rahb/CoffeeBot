# CoffeeBot

This is a bot, that watches the pot, and reminds you if you forgot.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6 or higher
* Webcam
* Computer (even a potato should do)
* Coffee machine
* Coffee cup
* Propensity to forget your cup at the coffee machine

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into the cloned repository with `cd CoffeeBot`
3. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Launch the bot with `python3 cup_detector.py`

That's it! Your coffee machine monitoring system should be up and running, so your coworkers won't have to remind you to get your cup anymore, and you can enjoy your coffee while it's still hot.
